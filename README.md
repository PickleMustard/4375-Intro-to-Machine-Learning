# 4375-Intro-to-Machine-Learning
Repository containing all work done for the 4375 Intro to Machine Learning class. 

This repository contains all my work from a machine learning class I took in college. I had originally taken the class out of interest in more of the deep learning side but getting aquianted with the entire field was rather interesting. The connection between statistics and the field was not one I had thought of before the class but was an interesting side to it. The class went over a lot of the basics of Machine Learning.
